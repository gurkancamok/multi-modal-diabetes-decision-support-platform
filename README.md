## Overview

This project is a multi-modal digital health decision support application designed to assist healthcare professionals in applying evidence-based diabetes treatment protocols through an intuitive digital interface.

The platform consolidates multiple diabetes management workflows into a single, browser-based application, reducing reliance on static tables and manual interpretation.

---

## Clinical Problem

Diabetes management protocols are often delivered through paper-based guidelines or static reference tables.  
This approach may lead to:

- Increased cognitive load
- Variability in protocol interpretation
- Delays in clinical decision-making
- Higher risk of dosing errors

There is a clear need for interactive, protocol-aware digital tools that support standardized and safe clinical workflows.

---

## Solution

This application digitizes diabetes treatment protocols into interactive decision support modules that allow users to:

- Select protocol pathways
- Enter patient-specific parameters
- Instantly receive protocol-aligned guidance
- Access structured medication and infusion information

---

## Included Modules

- Insulin Sliding Scale Decision Support
- Glucose–Insulin–Potassium (GIK) Protocol Assistant
- Insulin Infusion Management Tool
- Oral Antidiabetic Drug (OAD) Information Guide

Each module functions independently while operating within a unified digital framework.
